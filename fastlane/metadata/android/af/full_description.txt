Orbot is a free proxy app that empowers other apps to use the Internet more securely. Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.

*** SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS ***
On some devices, a Samsung app is listening on the same network port that Orbot needs. Download 'SockStat' from Google Play. Look for the app on port 9050. Force stop and disable that app. You can also try to change Orbot's "Tor SOCKS" setting under the Debug section to 9051 or AUTO. You can see the fix in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK-nK4F67_g
*****

Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private Internet connection. As the New York Times writes, “when a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award.

★ ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.
