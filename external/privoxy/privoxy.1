.SH NAME
privoxy \- Privacy Enhancing Proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBprivoxy\fR [\fB\-\-help\fR ] [\fB\-\-version\fR ] [\fB\-\-no-daemon\fR ] [\fB\-\-pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR ] [\fB\-\-user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR ] [\fB\-\-chroot\fR ] [\fB\-\-pre-chroot-nslookup \fIhostname\fB\fR ] [\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR ]

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR may be invoked with the following command line
options:
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print brief usage info and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print version info and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-daemon\fR
Don't  become  a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process group
leader, don't detach from controlling tty, and do all logging there.
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR
On startup, write the process ID to \fIpidfile\fR.
Delete the \fIpidfile\fR on exit.
Failure to create or delete the \fIpidfile\fR
is non-fatal. If no \fB\-\-pidfile\fR option is given, no PID file will be used.
.TP
\fB\-\-user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR
After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of
\fIuser\fR and the GID of
\fIgroup\fR, or, if the optional
\fIgroup\fR was not given, the default group of
\fIuser\fR. Exit if the privileges are not
sufficient to do so.
.TP
\fB\-\-chroot\fR
Before changing to the user ID given in the \-\-user option, chroot to
that user's home directory, i.e. make the kernel pretend to the
\fBPrivoxy\fR process that the directory tree starts
there. If set up carefully, this can limit the impact of possible
vulnerabilities in \fBPrivoxy\fR to the files contained in
that hierarchy. 
.TP
\fB\-\-pre-chroot-nslookup \fIhostname\fB\fR
Initialize the resolver library using \fIhostname\fR
before chroot'ing. On some systems this reduces the number of files
that must be copied into the chroot tree.
.PP
If the \fIconfigfile\fR is not specified on  the  command  line,
\fBPrivoxy\fR  will  look for a file named
\fIconfig\fR in the current directory. If no
\fIconfigfile\fR is found, \fBPrivoxy\fR will 
fail to start.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities
for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes.
It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
.PP
Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GPL2.
.SH "INSTALLATION AND USAGE"
.PP
Browsers can either be individually configured to use
\fBPrivoxy\fR as a HTTP proxy (recommended),
or \fBPrivoxy\fR can be combined with a packet
filter to build an intercepting proxy
(see \fIconfig\fR).  The default setting is  for
localhost,  on port  8118 (configurable in the main config file).  To set the
HTTP proxy in Firefox, go through: \fBTools\fR; 
\fBOptions\fR; \fBGeneral\fR;
\fBConnection Settings\fR;
\fBManual Proxy Configuration\fR. 
.PP
For Internet Explorer, go through: \fBTools\fR; 
\fBInternet Properties\fR; \fBConnections\fR;
\fBLAN Settings\fR. 
.PP
The Secure (SSL) Proxy should also be set to the same values, otherwise
https: URLs will not be proxied. Note: \fBPrivoxy\fR can only
proxy HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Do not try it with FTP or other protocols.
HTTPS presents some limitations, and not all features will work with HTTPS 
connections.
.PP
For other browsers, check the documentation.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR can be configured with the various configuration
files. The default configuration files are: \fIconfig\fR,
\fIdefault.filter\fR, \fIdefault.action\fR and
\fIdefault.action\fR. \fIuser.action\fR should 
be used for locally defined exceptions to the default rules in
\fImatch-all.action\fR and \fIdefault.action\fR,
and \fIuser.filter\fR for locally defined filters. These are
well commented.  On Unix and Unix-like systems, these are located in
\fI/etc/privoxy/\fR by default. 
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR uses the concept of \fBactions\fR 
in order to manipulate the data stream between the browser and remote sites.
There are various actions available with specific functions for such things 
as blocking web sites, managing cookies, etc. These actions can be invoked
individually or combined, and used against individual URLs, or groups of URLs 
that can be defined using wildcards and regular expressions. The result is
that the user has greatly enhanced control and freedom.
.PP
The actions list (ad blocks, etc) can also be configured with your
web browser at http://config.privoxy.org/ 
(assuming the configuration allows it).
\fBPrivoxy's\fR configuration parameters  can also  be viewed at
the same page. In addition, \fBPrivoxy\fR can be toggled on/off.
This is an internal page, and does not require Internet access.
.PP
See the \fIUser Manual\fR for a detailed
explanation of installation, general usage, all configuration options, new
features and notes on upgrading.
.SH "FILES"

.nf
 
 \fI/usr/sbin/privoxy\fR

.fi
.PP
Various other files should be included, but may vary depending on platform
and build configuration. Additional documentation should be included in the local
documentation directory.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR terminates on the \fBSIGINT\fR,
\fBSIGTERM\fR and \fBSIGABRT\fR signals. Log
rotation scripts may cause a re-opening of the logfile by sending a 
\fBSIGHUP\fR to \fBPrivoxy\fR. Note that unlike
other daemons,  \fBPrivoxy\fR does not need to be made aware of
config file changes by \fBSIGHUP\fR -- it will detect them
automatically. 
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Please see the \fIUser Manual\fR on how to contact the
developers, for feature requests, reporting problems, and other questions.
