<para>
 We value your feedback. In fact, we rely on it to improve
 <application>Privoxy</application> and its configuration.
 However, please note the following hints, so we can
 provide you with the best support:
</para>

<sect2 id="contact-support"><title>Get Support</title>
<para>
 For casual users, our
 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&#38;atid=211118">support forum at SourceForge</ulink>
 is probably best suited:
 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&#38;atid=211118">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&#38;atid=211118</ulink>
</para>

<para>
 All users are of course welcome to discuss their issues on the <ulink
 url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ijbswa-users">users
 mailing list</ulink>, where the developers also hang around.
</para>

<para>
 Please don't sent private support requests to individual Privoxy
 developers, either use the mailing lists or the support trackers.
</para>

<para>
 If you have to contact a Privoxy developer directly for other reasons,
 please send a real mail and do not bother with SourceForge's messaging
 system. Answers to SourceForge messages are usually bounced by SourceForge's
 mail server in which case the developer wasted time writing a response you
 don't get. From your point of view it will look like your message has
 been completely ignored, so this is frustrating for all parties involved.
</para>

<para>
 Note that the Privoxy mailing lists are moderated. Posts from unsubscribed
 addresses have to be accepted manually by a moderator. This may cause a
 delay of several days and if you use a subject that doesn't clearly
 mention Privoxy or one of its features, your message may be accidentally
 discarded as spam.
</para>

<para>
 If you aren't subscribed, you should therefore spend a few seconds
 to come up with a proper subject. Additionally you should make it clear
 that you want to get CC'd. Otherwise some responses will be directed to
 the mailing list only, and you won't see them.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="reporting"><title>Reporting Problems</title>
<para>
<quote>Problems</quote> for our purposes, come in two forms:
</para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Configuration issues, such as ads that slip through, or sites that
    don't function properly due to one <application>Privoxy</application>
    <quote>action</quote> or another being turned <quote>on</quote>.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    <quote>Bugs</quote> in the programming code that makes up
    <application>Privoxy</application>, such as that might cause a crash.
   </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<sect3 id="contact-ads"><title>Reporting Ads or Other Configuration Problems</title>
<para>
 Please send feedback on ads that slipped through, innocent images that were
 blocked, sites that don't work properly, and other configuration related problem of
 <filename>default.action</filename> file, to
 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=460288">
 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=460288</ulink>,
 the Actions File Tracker.
</para>

<para>
 New, improved <filename>default.action</filename> files may occasionally be made
 available based on your feedback. These will be announced on the <ulink
 url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ijbswa-announce">ijbswa-announce</ulink>
 list and available from our the <ulink
 url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11118">files section</ulink> of
 our <ulink url="http://sf.net/projects/ijbswa/">project page</ulink>.
</para>
</sect3>


<sect3 id="contact-bugs"><title>Reporting Bugs</title>
<para>
 Please report all bugs through our bug tracker:
 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
  Before doing so, please make sure that the bug has <emphasis>not already been submitted</emphasis>
  and observe the additional hints at the top of the <ulink
  url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118">submit
  form</ulink>. If already submitted, please feel free to add any info to the
  original report that might help to solve the issue.
</para>

<para>
  Please try to verify that it is a <application>Privoxy</application> bug,
  and not a browser or site bug or documented behaviour that just happens
  to be different than what you expected. If unsure,
  try <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/toggle?set=disable">toggling
  off</ulink> <application>Privoxy</application>, and see if the problem persists.
</para>

<para>
  If you are using your own custom configuration, please try
  the stock configs to see if the problem is configuration related.
  If you're having problems with a feature that is disabled by default,
  please ask around on the mailing list if others can reproduce the problem.
</para>

<para>
  If you aren't using the latest Privoxy version, the bug may have been found
  and fixed in the meantime. We would appreciate if you could take the time
  to <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/installation.html">upgrade
  to the latest version</ulink> (or  even the latest CVS snapshot) and verify
  that your bug still exists.
</para>
<para>
  Please be sure to provide the following information:
</para>
<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The operating system and versions you run
    <application>Privoxy</application> on, (e.g. <application>Windows
    XP SP2</application>), if you are using a Unix flavor,
    sending the output of <quote>uname -a</quote> should do,
    in case of GNU/Linux, please also name the distribution.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>

    you were using (e.g. <application>Internet Explorer v5.5</application> for Mac).
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The URL where the problem occurred, or some way for us to duplicate the
    problem (e.g. <literal>http://somesite.example.com/?somethingelse=123</literal>).
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>

   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Any other pertinent information to help identify the problem such as config
    or log file excerpts (yes, you should have log file entries for each
    action taken). To get a meaningful logfile, please make sure that the
    <ulink url="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE">logfile directive</ulink>
    is being used and the following <ulink
    url="../user-manual/config.html#DEBUG">debug options</ulink> are enabled:
    <literallayout>debug     1 # Log the destination for each request Privoxy let through. See also debug 1024.
debug     2 # show each connection status
debug     4 # show I/O status
debug     8 # show header parsing
debug   128 # debug redirects
debug   256 # debug GIF de-animation
debug   512 # Common Log Format
debug  1024 # Log the destination for requests Privoxy didn't let through, and the reason why.
debug  4096 # Startup banner and warnings.
debug  8192 # Non-fatal errors</literallayout>
    If you are having trouble with a filter, please additionally enable
    <literallayout>debug    64 # debug regular expression filters</literallayout>
    If you are using Privoxy 3.0.17 or later and suspect that it interprets the
    request or the response incorrectly, please enable
    <literallayout>debug 32768 # log all data read from the network</literallayout>
    Note that Privoxy log files may contain sensitive information so please don't
    submit any logfiles you didn't read first. You can mask sensitive information
    as long as it's clear that you removed something.

  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 You don't have to tell us your actual name when filing a problem
 report, but if you don't, please use a nickname so we can differentiate
 between your messages and the ones entered by other "anonymous" users that
 may respond to your request if they have the same problem or already
 found a solution. Note that due to spam the trackers may not always
 allow to post without being logged into SourceForge. If that's the
 case, you are still free to create a login that isn't directly linked
 to your name, though.
</para>

<para>
 Please also check the status of your request a few days after submitting
 it, as we may request additional information. If you use a SF id,
 you should automatically get a mail when someone responds to your request.
 Please don't bother to add an email address when using the tracker.
 If you prefer to communicate through email, just use one of the mailing
 lists directly.
