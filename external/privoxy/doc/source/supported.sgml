<para>
 At present, <application>Privoxy</application> is known to run on
 Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista), GNU/Linux (RedHat, SuSE, Debian,
 Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD,
 NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and various other flavors of Unix.

<![%p-supp-userman;[
<para>
 But any operating system that runs TCP/IP, can conceivably take advantage of
 <application>Privoxy</application> in a networked situation where
 <application>Privoxy</application> would run as a server on a LAN gateway. 
 Then only the <quote>gateway</quote> needs to be running one of the above
 operating systems.
</para>

<para>
 Source code is freely available, so porting to other operating systems 
 is always a possibility.
