      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHO-USES" id="WHO-USES">1.1. Who should give
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> a try?</a></h3>

      <p>Anyone who is interested in security, privacy, or in finer-grained
      control over their web and Internet experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="BESTCHOICE" id="BESTCHOICE">1.2. Is Privoxy
      the best choice for me?</a></h3>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is certainly a good choice,
      especially for those who want more control and security. Those with the
      willingness to read the documentation and the ability to fine-tune
      their installation will benefit the most.</p>

      <p>One of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> strengths is that
      it is highly configurable giving you the ability to completely
      personalize your installation. Being familiar with, or at least having
      an interest in learning about <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http" target="_top">HTTP</a> and other
      networking protocols, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html"
      target="_top">HTML</a>, and <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target=
      "_top"><span class="QUOTE">"Regular Expressions"</span></a> will be a
      big plus and will help you get the most out of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. A new installation just includes a very
      basic configuration. The user should take this as a starting point
      only, and enhance it as he or she sees fit. In fact, the user is
      encouraged, and expected to, fine-tune the configuration.</p>

      <p>Much of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> configuration can
      be done with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"
      target="_top">Web browser</a>. But there are areas where configuration
      is done using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editors"
      target="_top">text editor</a> to edit configuration files. Also note
      that the web-based action editor doesn't use authentication and should
      only be enabled in environments where all clients with access to
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> listening port can be
      trusted.</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="PROXYMORON" id="PROXYMORON">1.3. What is a
      <span class="QUOTE">"proxy"</span>? How does Privoxy work?</a></h3>

      <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server" target=
      "_top">web proxy</a> is a service, based on a software such as
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, that clients (i.e. browsers)
      can use instead of connecting to web servers directly. The clients then
      ask the proxy to request objects (web pages, images, movies etc) on
      their behalf and to forward the data to the clients. It is a
      <span class="QUOTE">"go-between"</span>. For details, see <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server" target="_top">Wikipedia's
      proxy definition</a>.</p>

      <p>There are many reasons to use web proxies, such as security
      (firewalling), efficiency (caching) and others, and there are any
      number of proxies to accommodate those needs.</p>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is a proxy that is
      primarily focused on privacy enhancement, ad and junk elimination and
      freeing the user from restrictions placed on his activities. Sitting
      between your browser(s) and the Internet, it is in a perfect position
      to filter outbound personal information that your browser is leaking,
      as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do this,
      all of which are under your complete control via the various
      configuration files and options. Being a proxy also makes it easier to
      share configurations among multiple browsers and/or users.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="OTHERSTUFF" id="OTHERSTUFF">1.4. Does
      Privoxy do anything more than ad blocking?</a></h3>

      <p>Yes, ad blocking is but one possible use. There are many, many ways
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can be used to sanitize and
      customize web browsing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="NEWJB" id="NEWJB">1.5. What is this new
      version of <span class="QUOTE">"Junkbuster"</span>?</a></h3>

      <p>A long time ago, there was the <a href=
      "http://www.junkbusters.com/ijb.html" target="_top"><span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span></a>, by Anonymous Coders and
      <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/" target="_top">Junkbusters
      Corporation</a>. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days
      of web advertising and user tracking.</p>

      <p>But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the
      techniques for forcing ads on users, give up autonomy over their
      browsing, and for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the
      <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span> did not. Version
      2.0.2, published in 1998, was (and is) the last official <a href=
      "http://www.junkbusters.com/ijbdist.html#release" target=
      "_top">release</a> available from <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com"
      target="_top">Junkbusters Corporation</a>. Fortunately, it had been
      released under the GNU <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target=
      "_top">GPL</a>, which allowed further development by others.</p>

      <p>So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an improved version of the
      software, to which eventually a number of people contributed patches.
      It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a
      first version of pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on
      the original, with all its limitations, such as the lack of HTTP/1.1
      support, flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The
      last release from this effort was version 2.0.2-10, published in
      2000.</p>

      <p>Then, some <a href=
      "http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS" target=
      "_top">developers</a> picked up the thread, and started turning the
      software inside out, upside down, and then reassembled it, adding many
      <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES"
      target="_top">new features</a> along the way.</p>

      <p>The result of this is <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>,
      whose first stable version, 3.0, was released August, 2002.</p>
    </div>

      all?</a></h3>

      <p>Though outdated, <a href="http://junkbusters.com/" target=
      "_top">Junkbusters Corporation</a> continues to offer their original
      version of the <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span>, so
      publishing our <span class="APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span>-derived
      software under the same name led to confusion.</p>

      <p>There are also potential legal complications from our use of the
      <span class="APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> name, which is a registered
      trademark of <a href="http://junkbusters.com/" target=
      "_top">Junkbusters Corporation</a>. There are, however, no objections
      from Junkbusters Corporation to the <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> project itself, and they, in fact, still
      share our ideals and goals.</p>

      <p>The developers also believed that there are so many improvements
      over the original code, that it was time to make a clean break from the
      past and make a name in their own right.</p>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is the <span class=
      "QUOTE">"<span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">Privacy Enhancing
      Proxy</span>"</span>. Also, its content modification and junk

      personal and <span class="QUOTE">"<span class=

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="DIFFERS" id="DIFFERS">1.7. How does Privoxy
      differ from the old Junkbuster?</a></h3>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> picks up where <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> left off. The new <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> still blocks ads and banners, still
      manages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target=
      "_top">cookies</a>, and still helps protect your privacy. But, most of
      these features have been enhanced, and many new ones have been added,
      all in the same vein.</p>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s new features include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be
          kept alive independently from the client.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too, and
          the configure script detects it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on
          client and server headers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need
          to configure browsers individually.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server
          and client headers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Can be chained with other proxies.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Integrated browser-based configuration and control utility at
          <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/" target=
          "_top">http://config.privoxy.org/</a> (shortcut: <a href=
          "http://p.p/" target="_top">http://p.p/</a>). Browser-based tracing
          of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on
          size, invisible <span class="QUOTE">"web-bugs"</span> and HTML
          annoyances, etc.)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and
          user settings to reside in separate files, so that installing
          updated actions files won't overwrite individual user settings.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the
          configuration files, and a more sophisticated and flexible
          configuration syntax.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>GIF de-animation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script
          redirection).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages
          (e.g. "blocked" page).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location
          basis.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Many smaller new features added, limitations and bugs
          removed.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHATSANAD" id="WHATSANAD">1.8. How does
      Privoxy know what is an ad, and what is not?</a></h3>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s approach to blocking ads
      is twofold:</p>

      <p>First, there are certain patterns in the <span class=
      "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">locations</span> (URLs) of banner images. This
      applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many web sites serve
      their banners from a directory called <span class=
      "QUOTE">"banners"</span>!) and the host (blocking the big banner
      hosting services like doublecklick.net already helps a lot).
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> takes advantage of this fact
      by using <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS" target=
      "_top">URL patterns</a> to sort out and block the requests for things
      that sound like they would be ads or banners.</p>

      <p>Second, banners tend to come in certain <span class=
      "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">sizes</span>. But you can't tell the size of an
      image by its URL without downloading it, and if you do, it's too late
      to save bandwidth. Therefore, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
      also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while they are loaded, and
      replaces references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy
      references, so that your browser doesn't request them anymore in the
      first place.</p>

      <p>Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of
      course, freely and readily configurable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN163" id="AEN163">1.9. Can Privoxy make
      mistakes? This does not sound very scientific.</a></h3>

      <p>Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to
      have a broad rule accidentally block or change something by mistake.
      You will almost surely run into such situations at some point. It is
      tricky writing rules to cover every conceivable possibility, and not
      occasionally get false positives.</p>

      <p>But this should not be a big concern since the <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> configuration is very flexible, and
      includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can
      be addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.
      (<a href="trouble.html#BADSITE">See the Troubleshooting section
      below</a>.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN169" id="AEN169">1.10. Will I have to
      configure Privoxy before I can use it?</a></h3>

      <p>That depends on your expectations. The default installation should
      give you a good starting point, and block <span class=
      "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">most</span> ads and unwanted content, but many
      of the more advanced features are off by default, and require you to
      activate them.</p>

      <p>You do have to set up your browser to use <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> (see the <a href=
      "installation.html#FIRSTSTEP">Installation section below</a>).</p>

      <p>And you will certainly run into situations where there are false
      positives, or ads not being blocked that you may not want to see. In
      these cases, you would certainly benefit by customizing <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> configuration to more closely match your
      individual situation. And we encourage you to do this. This is where
      the real power of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> lies!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="LAN" id="LAN">1.11. Can Privoxy run as a
      server on a network?</a></h3>

      <p>Yes, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> runs as a server
      already, and can easily be configured to <span class=
      "QUOTE">"serve"</span> more than one client. See <a href=
      "configuration.html#LANCONFIG">How can I set up Privoxy to act as a
      proxy for my LAN</a> below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="BROWSERS2" id="BROWSERS2">1.12. My browser
      does the same things as Privoxy. Why should I use Privoxy at
      all?</a></h3>

      <p>Modern browsers do indeed have <span class=
      "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">some</span> of the same functionality as
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. Maybe this is adequate for
      you. But <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is very versatile and
      powerful, and can probably do a number of things your browser just
      can't.</p>

      <p>In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or
      have a LAN with multiple computers since <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can run as a server application. This way
      all the configuration is in one place, and you don't have to maintain a
      similar configuration for possibly many browsers or users.</p>

      <p>Note, however, that it's recommended to leverage both your browser's
      and <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> privacy enhancing
      features at the same time. While your browser probably lacks some
      features <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> offers, it should
      also be able to do some things more reliable, for example restricting
      and suppressing JavaScript.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHYTRUST" id="WHYTRUST">1.13. Why should I
      trust Privoxy?</a></h3>

      <p>The most important reason is because you have access to <span class=
      "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">everything</span>, and you can control
      everything. You can check every line of every configuration file
      yourself. You can check every last bit of source code should you
      desire. And even if you can't read code, there should be some comfort
      in knowing that other people can, and do read it. You can build the
      software from scratch, if you want, so that you know the executable is
      clean, and that it is <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">yours</span>.
      In fact, we encourage this level of scrutiny. It is one reason we use
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> ourselves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="LICENSE" id="LICENSE">1.14. Is there is a

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="SPYWARE" id="SPYWARE">1.15. Can Privoxy
      remove spyware? Adware? Viruses?</a></h3>

      <p>No, at least not reliably enough to trust it. <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is not designed to be a malware removal
      tool and the default configuration doesn't even try to filter out any
      malware.</p>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> could help prevent contact
      from (known) sites that use such tactics with appropriate configuration
      rules, and thus could conceivably prevent contamination from such
      sites. However, keeping such a configuration up to date would require a
      lot of time and effort that would be better spend on keeping your
      software itself up to date so it doesn't have known
      vulnerabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="OTHERADS" id="OTHERADS">1.16. Can I use
      Privoxy with other ad-blocking software?</a></h3>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> should work fine with other
      proxies and other software in general.</p>

      <p>But it is probably not necessary to use <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> in conjunction with other ad-blocking
      products, and this could conceivably cause undesirable results. It
      might be better to choose one software or the other and work a little
      to tweak its configuration to your liking.</p>

      <p>Note that this is an advice specific to ad blocking.</p>

        <p>Well, we <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">always</span> need
        help. There is something for everybody who wants to help us. We
        welcome new developers, packagers, testers, documentation writers or
        really anyone with a desire to help in any way. You <span class=
        "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">DO NOT</span> need to be a <span class=
        "QUOTE">"programmer"</span>. There are many other tasks available. In
        fact, the programmers often can't spend as much time programming
        because of some of the other, more mundane things that need to be
        done, like checking the Tracker feedback sections or responding to
        user questions on the mailing lists.</p>

        <p>So first thing, subscribe to the <a href=
        "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ijbswa-users" target=
        "_top">Privoxy Users</a> or the <a href=
        "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ijbswa-developers"
        target="_top">Privoxy Developers</a> mailing list, join the
        discussion, help out other users, provide general feedback or report
        problems you noticed.</p>

        <p>If you intend to help out with the trackers, you also might want
        to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/register.php" target=
        "_top">get an account on SourceForge.net</a> so we don't confuse you
        with the other name-less users.</p>

        <p>We also have a <a href="../developer-manual/index.html" target=
        "_top">Developer's Manual</a>. While it is partly out of date, it's
        still worth reading.</p>

        <p>Our <a href=
        "http://ijbswa.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ijbswa/current/TODO?view=markup"
        target="_top">TODO list</a> may be of interest to you as well. Please
        let us know if you want to work on one of the items listed.</p>

        to donate?</a></h4>

        <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is developed by unpaid
        volunteers and thus our current running costs are pretty low.
        Nevertheless, we have plans that will cost money in the future. They
        include, but aren't limited to spending money on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Hardware to help make sure <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> keeps running on platforms the
            developers currently can't test on and can be ported to
            others.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Technical books to educate our developers about said platforms
            or to improve their knowledge in general.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>More reliable hosting,</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We would like to get this money through donations made by our
        users.</p>

        <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> has therefore become an
        associated project of <a href=
        "http://www.spi-inc.org/about-spi/about-spi" target="_top">Software
        in the Public Interest (SPI)</a>, which allows us to receive
        donations. In the United States they are tax-deductible, in a few
        other western countries they might be tax-deductible in the
        future.</p>

        <p>If you read this section before you may notice that paying for the
        project domain privoxy.org is no longer on the list. It has been
        transferred to SPI is sponsored by Mythic Beasts Ltd.</p>

        <p>If you enjoy our software and feel like helping out with a
        donation, please have a look at <a href=
        "http://www.spi-inc.org/donations" target="_top">SPI's donation
        page</a> to see what the options are. If you have any questions
