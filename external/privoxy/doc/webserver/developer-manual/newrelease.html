>        When we release versions of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

        our work leaves our cozy secret lab and has to work in the cold
        RealWorld[tm]. Once it is released, there is no way to call it
        back, so it is very important that great care is taken to ensure
        that everything runs fine, and not to introduce problems in the
        very last minute.

><P
>      First you need to determine which version number the release will have. 
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> version numbers consist of three numbers,
      separated by dots, like in X.Y.Z (e.g. 3.0.0), where:
        <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>              X, the version major, is rarely ever changed. It is increased by one if
              turning a development branch into stable substantially changes the functionality,
              user interface or configuration syntax. Majors 1 and 2 were 
              <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Junkbuster</SPAN
>, and 3 will be the first stable
              <SPAN

            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>              Y, the version minor, represents the branch within the major version.
              At any point in time, there are two branches being maintained:
              The stable branch, with an even minor, say, 2N, in which no functionality is
              being added and only bug-fixes are made, and 2N+1, the development branch, in
              which the further development of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> takes
              place.
              This enables us to turn the code upside down and inside out, while at the same time
              providing and maintaining a stable version.
              The minor is reset to zero (and one) when the major is incremented. When a development
              branch has matured to the point where it can be turned into stable, the old stable branch
              2N is given up (i.e. no longer maintained), the former development branch 2N+1 becomes the
              new stable branch 2N+2, and a new development branch 2N+3 is opened.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>              Z, the point or sub version, represents a release of the software within a branch.
              It is therefore incremented immediately before each code freeze. 
              In development branches, only the even point versions correspond to actual releases,
              while the odd ones denote the evolving state of the sources on CVS in between.
              It follows that Z is odd on CVS in development branches most of the time. There, it gets
              increased to an even number immediately before a code freeze, and is increased to an odd
              number again immediately thereafter.
              This ensures that builds from CVS snapshots are easily distinguished from released versions.
              The point version is reset to zero when the minor changes.
            </P
><P
>              Stable branches work a little differently, since there should be
              little to no development happening in such branches. Remember,
              only bugfixes, which presumably should have had some testing
              before being committed. Stable branches will then have their 
              version reported as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0.0.0</TT
>, during that period 
              between releases when changes are being added. This is to denote 
              that this code is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not for release</I
></SPAN
>. Then 
              as the release nears, the version is bumped according: e.g. 
              <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3.0.1 -&#62; 0.0.0 -&#62; 3.0.2</TT
>.
            </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>     In summary, the main CVS trunk is the development branch where new
     features are being worked on for the next stable series. This should
     almost always be where the most activity takes place. There is always at
     least one stable branch from the trunk, e.g now it is
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3.0</TT
>, which is only used to release stable versions.
     Once the initial *.0 release of the stable branch has been done, then as a
     rule, only bugfixes that have had prior testing should be committed to
     the stable branch. Once there are enough bugfixes to justify a new
     release, the version of this branch is again incremented Example: 3.0.0
     -&#62; 3.0.1 -&#62; 3.0.2, etc are all stable releases from within the stable
     branch. 3.1.x is currently the main trunk, and where work on 3.2.x is
     taking place. If any questions, please post to the devel list
     <SPAN

    </P
><P
>     Developers should remember too that if they commit a bugfix to the stable 
     branch, this will more than likely require a separate submission to the 
     main trunk, since these are separate development trees within CVS. If you 
     are working on both, then this would require at least two separate check
     outs (i.e main trunk, <SPAN

        the man page (and the html version of the man page), and the PDF docs
        fall in this category. REAMDE, the man page, AUTHORS, and config
        should all also be committed to CVS for other packagers. The 
        formal docs should be uploaded to the webserver. See the
        Section "Updating the webserver" in this manual for details.
