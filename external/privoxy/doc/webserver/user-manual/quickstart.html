>4.1. Quickstart to Ad Blocking</A
></H2
><P
> Ad blocking is but one of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
>
 array of features. Many of these features are for the technically minded advanced 
 user. But, ad and banner blocking is surely common ground for everybody.</P
><P
> 
 This section will provide a quick summary of ad blocking so 
 you can get up to speed quickly without having to read the more extensive
 information provided below, though this is highly recommended.</P
><P
> First a bit of a warning ... blocking ads is much like blocking SPAM: the
 more aggressive you are about it, the more likely you are to block 
 things that were not intended. And the more likely that some things 
 may not work as intended. So there is a trade off here. If you want
 extreme ad free browsing, be prepared to deal with more
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"problem"</SPAN
> sites, and to spend more time adjusting the
 configuration to solve these unintended consequences. In short, there is 
 not an easy way to eliminate <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all</I
></SPAN
> ads. Either take 
 the easy way and settle for <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>most</I
></SPAN
> ads blocked with the
 default configuration, or jump in and tweak it for your personal surfing
 habits and preferences.</P
><P
> Secondly, a brief explanation of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's </SPAN
>
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Actions"</SPAN
> in this context, are 
 the directives we use to tell <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to perform
 some task relating to HTTP transactions (i.e. web browsing). We tell
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to take some <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"action"</SPAN
>. Each
 action has a unique name and function. While there are many potential
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>actions</SPAN
> in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
>
 arsenal, only a few are used for ad blocking. <A
HREF="actions-file.html#ACTIONS"
>Actions</A
>, and <A
HREF="actions-file.html"
>action
 configuration files</A
>, are explained in depth below.</P
><P
> Actions are specified in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> configuration,
 followed by one or more URLs to which the action should apply. URLs 
 can actually be URL type <A
HREF="actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS"
>patterns</A
> that use
 wildcards so they can apply potentially to a range of similar URLs. The
 actions, together with the URL patterns are called a section.</P
><P
> When you connect to a website, the full URL will either match one or more
 of the sections as defined in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> configuration,
 or not. If so, then <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will perform the
 respective actions. If not, then nothing special happens. Furthermore, web
 pages may contain embedded, secondary URLs that your web browser will
 use to load additional components of the page, as it parses the
 original page's HTML content. An ad image for instance, is just an URL
 embedded in the page somewhere. The image itself may be on the same server,
 or a server somewhere else on the Internet. Complex web pages will have many
 such embedded URLs. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can deal with each URL individually, so, for
 instance, the main page text is not touched, but images from such-and-such
 server are blocked.</P
><P
> The most important actions for basic ad blocking are:  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#BLOCK"
>block</A
></TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE"
>handle-as-image</A
></TT
>, 
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-EMPTY-DOCUMENT"
>handle-as-empty-document</A
></TT
>,and
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER"
>set-image-blocker</A
></TT
>:</P
><P
> <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#BLOCK"
>block</A
></TT
> - this is perhaps 
   the single most used action, and is particularly important for ad blocking.
   This action stops any contact between your browser and any URL patterns
   that match this action's configuration. It can be used for blocking ads,
   but also anything that is determined to be unwanted. By itself, it simply
   stops any communication with the remote server and sends
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>'s own built-in BLOCKED page instead to
   let you now what has happened (with some exceptions, see below).
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE"
>handle-as-image</A
></TT
> - 
   tells <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to treat this URL as an image.
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>'s default configuration already does this
   for all common image types (e.g. GIF), but there are many situations where this
   is not so easy to determine. So we'll force it in these cases. This is particularly
   important for ad blocking, since  only if we know that it's an image of
   some kind, can we replace it with an image of our choosing, instead of the 
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> BLOCKED page (which would only result in
   a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"broken image"</SPAN
> icon). There are some limitations to this
   though. For instance, you can't just brute-force an image substitution for
   an entire HTML page in most situations.

><LI
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-EMPTY-DOCUMENT"
>handle-as-empty-document</A
></TT
> - 
   sends an empty document instead of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> 
   normal BLOCKED HTML page. This is useful for file types that are neither 
   HTML nor images, such as blocking JavaScript files.

   <SPAN

   has hit a block rule. For this to come into play, the URL must match a

   configuration, <SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"

 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#FILTER"

> as well. Filters 
 are very different from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#BLOCK"
>blocks</A
></TT
>.
 A <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"block"</SPAN
> blocks a site, page, or unwanted contented. Filters
 are a way of filtering or modifying what is actually on the page. An example
 filter usage: a text replacement of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"no-no"</SPAN
> for
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"nasty-word"</SPAN
>. That is a very simple example. This process can be
 used for ad blocking, but it is more in the realm of advanced usage and has
 some pitfalls to be wary off.</P
><P
> The quickest way to adjust any of these settings is with your browser through
 the special <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> editor at <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</A
>
 (shortcut: <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/show-status</A
>). This 
 is an internal page, and does not require Internet access.</P
><P
> Note that as of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 3.0.7 beta the
 action editor is disabled by default. Check the
 <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS"
TARGET="_top"
>enable-edit-actions
  section in the configuration file</A
> to learn why and in which
 cases it's safe to enable again.</P
><P
> If you decided to enable the action editor, select the appropriate
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
> file, and click
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Edit</SPAN
>"</SPAN
>. It is best to put personal or
 local preferences in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
> since this is not
 meant to be overwritten during upgrades, and will over-ride the settings in
 other files. Here you can insert new <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
>, and URLs for ad
 blocking or other purposes, and make other adjustments to the configuration.
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will detect these changes automatically.</P
><P
> A quick and simple step by step example:</P
><P
> <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>     Right click on the ad image to be blocked, then select 
     <SPAN
