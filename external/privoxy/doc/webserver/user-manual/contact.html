    <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="CONTACT" id="CONTACT">11. Contacting the
    Developers, Bug Reporting and Feature Requests</a></h1>

    <p>We value your feedback. In fact, we rely on it to improve <span class=
    "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> and its configuration. However, please note
    the following hints, so we can provide you with the best support:</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="CONTACT-SUPPORT" id="CONTACT-SUPPORT">11.1.
      Get Support</a></h2>

      <p>For casual users, our <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=211118"
      target="_top">support forum at SourceForge</a> is probably best suited:
      <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=211118"
      target="_top">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=211118</a></p>

      <p>All users are of course welcome to discuss their issues on the
      <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ijbswa-users"
      target="_top">users mailing list</a>, where the developers also hang
      around.</p>

      <p>Please don't sent private support requests to individual Privoxy
      developers, either use the mailing lists or the support trackers.</p>

      <p>If you have to contact a Privoxy developer directly for other
      reasons, please send a real mail and do not bother with SourceForge's
      messaging system. Answers to SourceForge messages are usually bounced
      by SourceForge's mail server in which case the developer wasted time
      writing a response you don't get. From your point of view it will look
      like your message has been completely ignored, so this is frustrating
      for all parties involved.</p>

      <p>Note that the Privoxy mailing lists are moderated. Posts from
      unsubscribed addresses have to be accepted manually by a moderator.
      This may cause a delay of several days and if you use a subject that
      doesn't clearly mention Privoxy or one of its features, your message
      may be accidentally discarded as spam.</p>

      <p>If you aren't subscribed, you should therefore spend a few seconds
      to come up with a proper subject. Additionally you should make it clear
      that you want to get CC'd. Otherwise some responses will be directed to
      the mailing list only, and you won't see them.</p>

        Reporting Bugs</a></h3>

        <p>Please report all bugs through our bug tracker: <a href=
        "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118"
        target=
        "_top">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118</a>.</p>

        <p>Before doing so, please make sure that the bug has <span class=
        "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">not already been submitted</span> and observe
        the additional hints at the top of the <a href=
        "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=11118&amp;atid=111118"
        target="_top">submit form</a>. If already submitted, please feel free
        to add any info to the original report that might help to solve the
        issue.</p>

        <p>Please try to verify that it is a <span class=
        "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> bug, and not a browser or site bug or
        documented behaviour that just happens to be different than what you
        expected. If unsure, try <a href=
        "http://config.privoxy.org/toggle?set=disable" target="_top">toggling
        off</a> <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, and see if the
        problem persists.</p>

        <p>If you are using your own custom configuration, please try the
        stock configs to see if the problem is configuration related. If
        you're having problems with a feature that is disabled by default,
        please ask around on the mailing list if others can reproduce the
        problem.</p>

        <p>If you aren't using the latest Privoxy version, the bug may have
        been found and fixed in the meantime. We would appreciate if you
        could take the time to <a href=
        "http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/installation.html" target=
        "_top">upgrade to the latest version</a> (or even the latest CVS
        snapshot) and verify that your bug still exists.</p>

        <p>Please be sure to provide the following information:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The exact <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version you
            are using (if you got the source from CVS, please also provide
            the source code revisions as shown in <a href=
            "http://config.privoxy.org/show-version" target=
            "_top">http://config.privoxy.org/show-version</a>).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The operating system and versions you run <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> on, (e.g. <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Windows XP SP2</span>), if you are using a Unix
            flavor, sending the output of <span class="QUOTE">"uname
            -a"</span> should do, in case of GNU/Linux, please also name the
            distribution.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The name, platform, and version of the <span class=
            "APPLICATION">browser</span> you were using (e.g. <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Internet Explorer v5.5</span> for Mac).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The URL where the problem occurred, or some way for us to
            duplicate the problem (e.g. <tt class=
            "LITERAL">http://somesite.example.com/?somethingelse=123</tt>).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Whether your version of <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is one supplied by the <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> developers via SourceForge, or if
            you got your copy somewhere else.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Whether you are using <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
            in tandem with another proxy such as <span class=
            "APPLICATION">Tor</span>. If so, please temporary disable the
            other proxy to see if the symptoms change.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Whether you are using a personal firewall product. If so, does
            <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> work without it?</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Any other pertinent information to help identify the problem
            such as config or log file excerpts (yes, you should have log
            file entries for each action taken). To get a meaningful logfile,
            please make sure that the <a href=

        </ul>

        <p>You don't have to tell us your actual name when filing a problem
        report, but if you don't, please use a nickname so we can
        differentiate between your messages and the ones entered by other
        "anonymous" users that may respond to your request if they have the
        same problem or already found a solution. Note that due to spam the
        trackers may not always allow to post without being logged into
        SourceForge. If that's the case, you are still free to create a login
        that isn't directly linked to your name, though.</p>

        <p>Please also check the status of your request a few days after
        submitting it, as we may request additional information. If you use a
        SF id, you should automatically get a mail when someone responds to
        your request. Please don't bother to add an email address when using
        the tracker. If you prefer to communicate through email, just use one
        of the mailing lists directly.</p>
