ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.12 (UNRELEASED) ***

- The socket-timeout option now also works on platforms whose
  select() implementation modifies the timeout structure.
  Previously the timeout was triggered even if the connection
  didn't stall. Reported by cyberpatrol.
- The Connection: keep-alive code properly deals with files
  larger than 2GB. Previously the connection was closed too
  early.
- The content length for files above 2GB is logged correctly.
- The user-manual directive on the show-status page links to
  the documentation location specified with the directive,
  not to the Privoxy website.
- When running in daemon mode, Privoxy doesn't log anything
  to the console unless there are errors before the logfile
  has been opened.
- The show-status page prints warnings about invalid directives
  on the same line as the directives themselves.
- Fixed several justified (but harmless) compiler warnings,
  mostly on 64 bit platforms.
- The mingw32 version explicitly requests the default charset
  to prevent display problems with some fonts available on more
  recent Windows versions. Patch by Burberry.
- The mingw32 version uses the Privoxy icon in the alt-tab
  windows. Patch by Burberry.
- The timestamp and the thread id is omitted in the "Fatal error"
  message box on mingw32.
- Fixed two related mingw32-only buffer overflows. Triggering
  them required control over the configuration file, therefore
  this isn't seen as a security issue.
- In verbose mode, or if the new option --show-skipped-tests
  is used, Privoxy-Regression-Test logs skipped tests and the
  skip reason.

*** Version 3.0.11 ***
	
- On most platforms, outgoing connections can be kept alive and
  reused if the server supports it. Whether or not this improves
  things depends on the connection.
- When dropping privileges, membership in supplementary groups
  is given up as well. Not doing that can lead to Privoxy running
  with more rights than necessary and violates the principle of
  least privilege. Users of the --user option are advised to update.
  Thanks to Matthias Drochner for reporting the problem,
  providing the initial patch and testing the final version.
- Passing invalid users or groups with the --user option
  didn't lead to program exit. Regression introduced in 3.0.7.
- The match all section has been moved from default.action
  to a new file called match-all.action. As a result the
  default.action no longer needs to be touched by the user
  and can be safely overwritten by updates.
- The standard.action file has been removed. Its content
  is now part of the default.action file.
- In some situations the logged content length was slightly too low.
- Crunched requests are logged with their own log level.
  If you used "debug 1" in the past, you'll probably want
  to additionally enable "debug 1024", otherwise only passed
  requests will be logged. If you only care about crunched
  requests, simply replace "debug 1" with "debug 1024".
- The crunch reason has been moved to the beginning of the
  crunch message. For HTTP URLs, the protocol is logged as well.
- Log messages are shortened by printing the thread id on its
  own (as opposed to putting it inside the string "Privoxy()").
- The config option socket-timeout has been added to control
  the time Privoxy waits for data to arrive on a socket.
- Support for remote toggling is controlled by the configure
  option --disable-toggle only. In previous versions it also
  depended on the action editor and thus configuring with the
  --disable-editor option would disable remote toggling support
  as well.
- Requests with invalid HTTP versions are rejected.
- The template symbol @date@ can be used to include a date(1)-like
  time string. Initial patch submitted by Endre Szabo.
- Responses from shoutcast servers are accepted again.
  Problem reported and fix suggested by Stefan.
- The hide-forwarded-for-headers action has been replaced with
  the change-x-forwarded-for{} action which can also be used to
  add X-Forwarded-For headers. The latter functionality already
  existed in Privoxy versions prior to 3.0.7 but has been removed
  as it was often used unintentionally (by not using the
  hide-forwarded-for-headers action).
- A "clear log" view option was added to the mingw32 version
  to clear out all of the lines in the Privoxy log window.
  Based on a patch submitted by T Ford.
- The mingw32 version uses "critical sections" now, which prevents
  log message corruption under load. As a side effect, the
  "no thread-safe PRNG" warning could be removed as well.
- The mingw32 version's task bar icon is crossed out and
  the color changed to gray if Privoxy is toggled off.

*** Version 3.0.10 ***

- Ordinary configuration file changes no longer cause program
  termination on OS/2 if the name of the logfile hasn't been
  changed as well. This regression probably crept in with the
  logging improvements in 3.0.7. Reported by Maynard.
- The img-reorder filter is less likely to mess up JavaScript code in
  img tags. Problem and solution reported by Glenn Washburn in #2014552.
- The source tar ball now includes Privoxy-Log-Parser,
  a syntax-highlighter for Privoxy logs. For fancy screenshots see:
  http://www.fabiankeil.de/sourcecode/privoxy-log-parser/
  Documentation is available through perldoc(1).

*** Version 3.0.9 Beta ***

- Added SOCKS5 support (with address resolution done by
  the SOCKS5 server). Patch provided by Eric M. Hopper.
- The "blocked" CGI pages include a block reason that was
  provided as argument to the last-applying block action.
- If enable-edit-actions is disabled (the default since 3.0.7 beta)
  the show-status page hides the edit buttons and explains why.
  Previously the user would get the "this feature has been disabled"
  message after using the edit button.
- Forbidden CONNECT requests are treated like blocks by default.
  The now-pointless treat-forbidden-connects-like-blocks action
  has been removed.
- Not enabling limit-connect now allows CONNECT requests to all ports.
  In previous versions it would only allow CONNECT requests to port 443.
  Use +limit-connect{443} if you think you need the old default behaviour.
- The CGI editor gets turned off after three edit requests with invalid
  file modification timestamps. This makes life harder for attackers
  who can leverage browser bugs to send fake Referers and intend to
  brute-force edit URLs.
- Action settings for multiple patterns in the same section are
  shared in memory. As a result these sections take up less space
  (and are loaded slightly faster). Problem reported by Franz Schwartau.
- Linear white space in HTTP headers will be normalized to single
  spaces before parsing the header's content, headers split across
  multiple lines get merged first. This should prevent problems like:
   * letting the session-cookies-only action slip
     some Cookies through unmodified,
   * only suppressing the first line of a header,
     thus creating an invalid one, and
   * to incorrectly block headers with valid timestamps
     that weren't properly recognized.
  Headers that could trigger these problems are unlikely to appear
  in "normal" web traffic, but could be intentionally generated to
  fool some of Privoxy's header parsers.
- Host information is gathered outside the main thread so it's less
  likely to delay other incoming connections if the host is misconfigured.
- New config option "hostname" to use a hostname other than
  the one returned by the operating system. Useful to speed-up responses
  for CGI requests on misconfigured systems. Requested by Max Khon.
- The CGI editor supports the "disable all filters of this type"
  directives "-client-header-filter", "-server-header-filter",
  "-client-header-tagger" and "-server-header-tagger".
- Fixed false-positives with the link-by-url filter and URLs that
  contain the pattern "/jump/".
- The less-download-windows filter no longer messes
  "Content-Type: application/x-shockwave-flash" headers up.
- In the show-url-info page's "Final results" section active and
  inactive actions are listed separately. Patch provided by Lee.
- The GNUmakefile supports the DESTDIR variable. Patch for
  the install target submitted by Radoslaw Zielinski.
- Embedding the content of configuration files in the show-status
  page is significantly faster now. For a largish action file (1 MB)
  a speedup of about 2450 times has been measured. This is mostly
  interesting if you are using large action files or regularly use
  Privoxy-Regression-Test while running Privoxy through Valgrind,
  for stock configuration files it doesn't really matter.
- If zlib support is unavailable and there are content
  filters active but the prevent-compression action is disabled,
  the show-url-info page includes a warning that compression
  might prevent filtering.
- The show-url-info page provides an OpenSearch Description that
  allows to access the page through browser search plugins.
- Custom client-header filters that rewrite the request line
  incorrectly no longer cause Privoxy to crash. Reported by din_a4.
- The obsolete kill-popups action has been removed as the
  PCRS-based popup filters can do the same and are slightly
  less unreliable.
- The inspect-jpegs action has been removed.
- The send-wafer and send-vanilla-wafer actions have been removed.
  They weren't particular useful and their behaviour could be emulated
  with add-header anyway.
- Privoxy-Regression-Test has been significantly improved.
- Most sections in the default.action file contain tests for
  Privoxy-Regression-Test to verify that they are working as intended.
- Parts of Privoxy have been refactored to increase maintainability.
- Building with zlib (if available) is done by default.

*** Version 3.0.8 ***

- Fixed a small memory leak when listen-address only specifies the port.
- The source tar balls now include Privoxy-Regression-Test which
  (upon other things) can be used to automatically detect some
  packaging problems. Packagers are welcome to give it a try.
- Reverted a change in 3.0.7 that caused path patterns to be checked
  even if the host pattern match already failed. While this doesn't
  noticeable affect the performance, it makes it less likely to run
  out of stack space with overly-complex path patterns the user might
  have added.
- Updated the msn, yahoo and google filters to work as advertised again.
- The warning message shown by the show-status CGI page is easier to
  understand. Previously it wasn't clear that the error message
  is shown below the invalid directive. (Reported by Lee)
- When regenerating Content-Disposition headers the more common
  spelling is used for the name. Previously it was written without caps.
- Less confusing log message if the content type isn't overwritten
  because force-text-type wasn't used but the old type doesn't look
  like content that would be filtered normally.
- Better log messages if the user tries to execute filters that
  don't exist.
- Treat the non-standard Request-Range headers like standard range
  headers and suppress them if content filtering is enabled.
- Prevent the log messages for CONNECT requests to unacceptable
  ports from printing the limit-connect argument as [null] if
  limit-connect hasn't been explicitly enabled.
- Don't disable the mingw32 log window if the logfile directive
  isn't used. While it was an intentional change in 3.0.7 at least
  one user perceived it as a regression and the same effect can
  be achieved by disabling all debug directives.
- Fixed two minor problems related to the win32 build process: a css
  file was not being in the installer and the trustfile comment in the
  config.txt referenced a nonexisting file
- Minor documentation fixes.

*** Version 3.0.7 Beta ***

- Added zlib support to filter content with gzip and deflate
  encoding. (Patch provided by Wil Mahan)
- Dedicated filters and actions are used for header filtering.
  "filter-client-headers" and "filter-client-headers" are no longer
  supported, use server-header-filter{} and client-header-filter{}
  instead.
- Tags can be used to change actions based on HTTP headers.
- New server-header filter: less-download-windows.
- New client-header taggers: css-requests, image-requests,
  client-ip-address, http-method, allow-post, complete-url,
  user-agent and privoxy-control.
- New server-header taggers: content-type and privoxy-control.
- The forward-override{} action allows to change the forwarding
  settings through the action files, for example based on client
  headers like the User-Agent, or the request origin.
- Socks errors are no longer handled by the CGI page for
  DNS resolution failures.
- CGI pages use favicons to signal whether they are error
  or control pages. This is useful if you rely heavily on
  browser tabs.
- The show-url-info CGI page shows the forwarding settings.
- "Crunch!" log messages (used when Privoxy answers requests
  by itself) now also contain the reason.
- Allow to rewrite the request destination behind the client's back.
- Fix socks requests on big-endian platforms. Patch provided by Song Weijia.
- Fixes possible deadlocks and crashes on OpenBSD.
  Patch provided by Ralf Horstmann.
- The CGI action editor allows to edit actionfiles with previously
  forbidden characters like dots.
- New trust entries are saved with a comment that contains the
  trusted referring URL (Suggested by Daniel Griscom).
- Filter descriptions are HTML encoded automatically. 	
- New config option "split-large-forms" to work
  around a browser bug that caused IE6 and IE7 to ignore
  the Submit button on the edit-actions-for-url CGI page.
- New config option "allow-cgi-request-crunching" to allow
  requests for Privoxy's CGI pages to be blocked, redirected
  or (un)trusted like ordinary requests.
- Empty filter files no longer interrupt the filtering process
  prematurely and are correctly listed on the show-status CGI page.
- New config option "accept-intercepted-requests" to combine
  Privoxy with any packet filter to build an intercepting proxy
  for HTTP/1.1 requests (and for HTTP/1.0 requests with Host header set).
- fast-redirects{} catch redirects to https URLs as well.
- redirect{s@foo@bar@} can be used to redirect to a rewritten
  version of the original URL.
- Trap unsupported gopher proxy requests.
- Fixed a bug in the User Manual delivery on Windows
  (mingw32 only). Images now show up correctly and HTML
  pages are no longer padded with garbage data.
- Fixed several minor memory leaks, most of them discovered with Valgrind.
- Only unlink the pidfile if it's actually used.
- Retries after connection problems with forced requests
  aren't blocked again.
- On Unix SIGABRT causes a core dump as expected and is no
  longer treated as normal shutdown signal.
- The "access denied" CGI page is more descriptive and
  allows retries to circumvent the referrer check.
- Updated PCRS to handle unexpected PCRE errors properly.
  Fixed crashes that could occur if Privoxy was build
  with external PCRE versions newer than Privoxy's internal
  one. (Reported by Chung-chieh Shan)
- Fixed crashes with null bytes in PCRS replacement strings
  (Patch provided by Felix Gröbert).
- Fixed crashes with header time randomization on mingw32.
- The CGI style sheet is no longer delivered if the referring
  page isn't a Privoxy CGI page. This prevents a JavaScript-based
  Privoxy detection "attack". Note that detecting Privoxy is
  still possible through other ways and Privoxy was never intended
  to be invisible anyway.
- Added support for AmigaOS 4, fixed build for AmigaOS 3.x.	
- The show-url-info CGI page displays a warning if Privoxy
  is currently toggled off.
- The show-status CGI page suppresses the edit button
  for action files if Privoxy has no write access.	
- Most CGI error pages react properly to HEAD requests.
- Requests with RFC 3253 HTTP methods (used by Subversion)
  are accepted. (Patch provided by Petr Kadlec)
- New config option "templdir" to change the location
  of the CGI templates to make sure customized templates
  aren't "updated".
- Better handling of "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue" responses.
- The background of the PNG pattern is transparent.
- Fixed XML syntax errors caused by banners-by-size and banners-by-url.
- Fixed crashes and possible action file corruptions
  when lines containing hashes are written through the CGI editor.
- Supports dynamic filters which can contain variables.
- Supports tags to change the actions based on client or server headers.
- Incorrect actions are logged before program termination.
- The "actionsfile" syntax in the configuration file is consistent
  with the rest of the configuration options and requires the
  whole file name. This is an incompatible change, if you use
  an old configuration file you might have to append ".action"
  to your "actionsfile" directives.
- With the configuration file option "enforce-blocks" the
  "go there anyway" mechanism can be disabled without recompiling
  Privoxy.
- More precise error messages in case of incorrect acl syntax.
- Logs a warning if filtering is enabled but impossible due
  to lack of zlib support or use of the prevent-compression action.
- Less noisy handling of Cookie:" and "Connection:" headers.
- Improved error messages in case of connection problems.
- Fix a command-line-parsing bug that was introduced before 3.0.5
  beta and caused Privoxy to treat the last argument as configuration
  file if no configuration file was specified.
- Treat unknown command line options as fatal errors instead
  of silently ignoring them.
- Use string functions with length checks more often.
- Don't log CONNECT requests twice.
- Allow to log the source address for ACL-related connection drops.
- Don't ignore applying filters if the server didn't
  specify a Content-Type. Bug reported by Amuro Namie.
- Rejected CONNECT requests are logged with log level info
  (enabled by default) and the reason for the block.
- New command line option "--pre-chroot-nslookup hostname" to
  intialize the resolver library before chroot'ing. On some systems this
  reduces the number of files that must be copied into the chroot tree.
  (Patch provided by Stephen Gildea)
- Fix a long-standing memory corruption bug that could cause
  Privoxy to overwrite a single byte in memory it didn't explicitly
  allocate (but that probably was allocated anyway due to bucket size).
- Send template-based CGI pages as HTTP/1.1 unless the client
  asked for HTTP/1.0.
- Let the first line in connection established responses
  end in \r\n as required by RFC1945. Reported by Bert van Leeuwen.
- If no log file has been specified, disable logging instead of logging
  to stderr.
- Don't block stderr when in daemon mode.
- Ignore missing zero-chunks when filtering chunk-encoded content.
  Earlier Privoxy versions would buffer and then forward the content
  unmodified which caused some browsers to simply show empty pages.
- Fix double free in cgi_edit_actions_list(). Reported by Venustech AD-LAB.
- The code to add X-Forwarded-For headers when the hide-forwarded-for-headers
  action isn't being used has been removed.
- Fixed trustfile feature which previously didn't work without FEATURE_TOGGLE.
  Reported by Lee.
- Minor code clean-ups, filter and action file updates.
  (Some of them reported by Davide Alberani, Markus Elfring,
   Stefan Huehner and Adam Piggott)

*** Version 3.0.6 ***

- New content filters: no-ping, google, msn, yahoo and blogspot.
- New header filters:  x-httpd-php-to-html, html-to-xml, xml-to-html
                       and hide-tor-exit-notation.
- The special header "X-Filter: No" now disables header filtering as well.
- Improved the filters img-reorder, js-annoyances, webbugs,
  banners-by-size, banners-by-link and ie-exploits to make them
  less likely to break anything.
- Removed outdated URL patterns in default.action and added new ones. 
- Added redirection from http://p.p/user-manual to http://p.p/user-manual/
- Changed webinterface default values for hide-user-agent, hide-referrer
  and set-image-blocker.
	
*** Version 3.0.5 Beta ***

- Windows version can be installed/started as a service.
- Windows icon stays blue when Privoxy is idle, green when busy.
- Integrated Fabian Keil's extensive patch.  See:
  http://www.fabiankeil.de/sourcecode/privoxy/. Includes the 
  following new or significantly improved actions (among many 
  other improvements):

     content-type-overwrite{}
     crunch-client-header{string}
     crunch-if-none-match
     crunch-server-header{string}
     fast-redirects{check-decoded-url}
     filter-client-headers
     filter-server-headers
     force-text-mode
     handle-as-empty-document
     hide-accept-language{}
     hide-content-disposition{}
     hide-if-modified-since
     hide-referrer{conditional-block}
     overwrite-last-modified{}
     redirect{URL}
     treat-forbidden-connects-like-blocks

  with the new inspect-jpegs action.
- Removed the "arbitrary" 1000 filter limit - addresses tracker #911950
- Thanks to Jindrich Makovicka for a race condition fix for the log 
  file.  The race condition remains for non-pthread implementations.
  Reference patch #1175720. Various other logging enhancements.

- Numerous updates to default.action
- Increase the compiled in limit of trusted referrers from 64 to 512 
  (for trustfile users).

*** Version 3.0.3 ***

- Fixed yet another two memory leaks. Process growth seems stopped now.
- Further tightened security against malicious toggle-off links.
- Excluded text/plain MIME types from filtering. This fixes a
  couple of client-crashing, download corruption and
  Privoxy performance issues, whose root cause lies in
  web servers labelling content of unknown type as text/plain.
- Assorted fixes for POSIX compliance, signal handling, graceful
  termination, compiler warnings, OSX support, Win32 systray,
  error logging, hostname wildcards, correct detection of NetBSD.
- Workarounds for client (iTunes etc) and server (PHP < 4.2.3) bugs
  including the notorious "blank page" problem.
- Various filter improvements; most notably the unsolicited-popups
  filter became less destructive     
- Major revamp of the actions file
	
*** Version 3.0.2 ***

    img-reorder, banners-by-size, banners-by-link, webbugs, refresh-tags,
    html-annoyances, content-cookies and fun filters
  - Replaced filter "popups" by choice between two modes:
    - "unsolicited-popups" tries to catch only the unsolicited ones
    - "all-popups" tries to kill them all (as before)
  - New filter "tiny-textforms" Help those tiny or hard-wrap textareas. 
  - New filter "jumping-windows" that prevents windows from resizing
    and moving themselves
  - New filter "demoronizer" which fixes MS's abuse of std charsets
    (common cases anyway).
  - Replaced "nimda" with more general "ie-exploits" filter in which
    all filters for exploits shall be collected
- Improved cookie logging
- Rewrote make install target. Added uninstall and install-strip
  targets.
- Fixed a potential (application-level, NOT OS-level!) security
  problem involving remote toggling and action file manipulation
  by mailicious websites.
- Added ability to chroot (thanks to Sviatoslav Sviridov)
- Added more action aliases for prehistoric action names
- Add Slackware support to Makefile.

- The usual many small and miscellaneous bug and security fixes.

*** Version 2.9.14 Beta *** 

- Fix Solaris compile problem (gateway.h and filters.h)
- Makefile fixes for Solaris, FreeBSD (?)

image).
- one case where there were both local and global "referrer" variables
(yuck!) clarified by renaming the local one to "refer".
- Fixed some places where close() was used instead of close_socket().
Thanks to Jörg Strohmayer (joergs at users.sourceforge.net) for these.
- Temporary hack to get FORCE_LOAD to work with IE.  I just lowercased the
FORCE_LOAD_PREFIX.  Needs fixing properly.
- Most URLs hardcoded into Junkbuster were changed to go through a script
e.g. http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/redirect.php?v=2.9.3&to=faq
The only other URLs left are the GNU GPL:
  http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
and the home page:
  http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/
... and various URLs which will be intercepted by Junkbuster anyway.
TODO: Still need to do something with the URLs in Junkbuster Corp's 
copyright/trademark notice on the bottom of the show-proxy-args page.
- PCRE or GNU Regex is now a #define option.


*** Version 2.9.2 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Andreas applied the latest version of the FORCE patch.


*** Version 2.9.1 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- in parsers.c, fixed two #ifdef FORCE to #ifdef FORCE_LOAD
(BTW: I think FORCE is precise enough, since loading remote
data is the whole purpose of a proxy..)
- Set the FORCE_PREFIX (back) to 'IJB-FORCE-LOAD-'. While 'noijb.'
is more elegant and looks like a hostname in the URL, it doesn't
make clear to the inexperienced user that the proxy is bypassed. It
also has a higher name collision risk.
- Filled in the function header templates for my functions in
parsers.c (again). They obviously got lost in our current
patch war ;-)
- Cut the credit for the §-referrer-option from the config file,
that Stefan had placed there.
- Improved the re_filterfile 


*** Version 2.9.0 pre-Alpha Changes ***

-  Now use PCRE, not GNU REGEX.  I have not yet had chance to check the
syntax of the block/image/cookie file to ensure that they match what
is expected - however they seem to work.
-  Replaced "configure" script with one generated by "autoconf".  Also 
use a header "config.h" (was ijbconfig.h in my previous release) for 
the #defines.  "config.h" is now generated with "autoheader" from 
"acconfig.h" and "configure.in".  (Note that to install you do not
need autoconf or autoheader - just run "./configure".)
To see command-line options, run "./configure --help".
This is my first ever autoconf script, so it has some rough edges
(how PCRE is handled is the roughest).
-  Error logging code replaced with new module errlog.c, based on the
one from JunkbusterMT (but with the threading code removed).
-  Most of Rodney's 0.21 and 0.21A patches applied. (Marked *).  I did not
apply all of these, since I had already independently done conditional
popup file, conditional image file, and integration of popup code.
- ACL, Jar and trust files conditionally compiled.
- New source file headers.
- Various cosmetic changes.  (But I have not consistently ordered the 
config files - I think that's worthwhile, but it's 1am and I want to
get this released!)
- RCS tags on .h files.
-  RCS tags are const char[] rather than const char *.  (Saves 4 bytes
per tag ;-)
- VC++ project files renamed to vc_junkbuster.*.
- show-proxy-args now shows status of all conditionals, not just REGEX
- Various functions moved around.  Most notably all the system-specific
sockets code which was spread between jcc.c, bind.c, and connect.c,
has been moved to "jbsockets.c".  The non-system-specific code from
connect.c and socks4.c has been movet to "gateway.c".  Also, the
config file loader and the global variables it writes to have been
moved to "loadcfg.c".  (Maybe this should go into loaders.c?)
And candidate for the "worst filename ever" award is "miscutil.c",
which contains, well, miscellaneous utility functions like zalloc.
(Suggestions for a better name for this file are welcome!)
- Loaders now use a common function to read a line and skip comments,
and this function also stores the proxy_args.
- Added ./junkbuster --help     (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Added ./junkbuster --version  (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Win32 resources are now all marked as "U.S. English", rather than
being a mix of "U.S. English", "U.K. English" and "Irish English".
- Version number changes to 2.9.0
